When we finally reached the village, Throckmorton and I ran to the well to have a sorely-needed drink.
We had walked for days through the desert, which science tells us is usually quite a warm place - especially during the day, which it certainly was.
But not now, because it's night now.
Right now is the time that it is and there is no changing the now. Only the future.
The future is so uncertain, but at least it is not the now. The now is the worst.
